# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the management of changes to software code. It is very helpful because it helps users keep track of any edits and allows the users to all work on the same codebase either remotely or locally.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a different path you create from the original code base. It allows you to work independently of that code while allowing you revise the original software without affecting the original code until you are ready to make final changes. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically the addition of edits to your code history. A good message is clear, concise and describes the change you are adding to your code.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the exact same part of the same file and then the files are merged.
