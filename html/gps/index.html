<!--The purpose of semantic tags is to clearly define its content both to the developer as well as the browser as opposed to non-semantic tags which tell nothing about their contents. I do not think one tag is more useful than another as they all serve a certain purpose and one can be more useful in one document, while another tag can be way more useful in another. The browser displays the elments on the page from top to bottom. I learned that you can create templates for projects based on the language you are writing in. I do believe I will create handy snippets down the line as my skills progress and need to create shortcuts. I realized I have to visualize a lot of the code I am writing. I was difficult for me to create the table because until I actually opened the file in the browser.-->
